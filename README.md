# Liri Node App

This node app takes four commands in the command line and makes a different API call for each command on the back end using npm packages. You can search your latest tweets with the command "my-tweets," search for info on a certain song with the command "spotify-this-song" and the song name, search for info from IMDB with the command "movie-this," or store future commands in a txt file for later with the command "do-what-it-says." You do have to know the commands to operate the app, however.
